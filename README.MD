**PlatformTools** is a Kotlin Multiplatform library designed to provide platform-specific utilities and tools for managing operating systems, application installation, and release fetching seamlessly across various platforms. The library is modular and divided into three main components: core, appmanager, and releasefetcher.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core

- **Platform Detection**\
  Identify the current platform or operating system, such as Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, JS, or WASM.

### AppManager (JVM and Android only)

- **App Installation Management**\
  Check and request permissions for installing applications, install and uninstall apps, and manage application packages seamlessly.

### ReleaseFetcher

- **Release Management**\
  Fetch the latest release information from GitHub repositories, check for updates, and download release files tailored to the platform.
- **File Downloader**\
  Easily download application files with progress tracking through the Downloader class.
- **Update Checker**\
  Includes a function to check for updates (`checkForUpdate`). This function determines whether a newer version of the application is available and provides the new version details and changelog if an update is needed.
- **Platform-specific Download Link Retrieval**\
  Contains a function (`getDownloadLinkForPlatform`) to retrieve the download link for a release asset suitable for the current platform (e.g., APK for Android, MSI for Windows).

## üì¶ Installation

Add the following dependencies to your Kotlin Multiplatform project:

### Core

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools:core:0.1.1")
```

### AppManager

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools:appmanager:0.1.1")
```

### ReleaseFetcher

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools:releasefetcher:0.1.1")
```

## üåü Modules

### Core

The main goal of this library is to serve as a versatile toolkit for implementing platform-specific utilities. While this approach might seem contrary to the expect/actual pattern of Kotlin Multiplatform, PlatformTools fills a specific gap:

- It enables operating system detection within the JVM, which is not natively supported by KMP.
- It allows OS detection in common code for minor functionalities where embedding such logic can be beneficial.

The core module provides tools for platform detection, including support for enums to represent different platforms:

```kotlin
import io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools.Platform
import io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools.getPlatform

val platform = getPlatform()
println("Current platform: $platform")
```

### AppManager (JVM and Android only)

The appmanager module provides an interface for managing application installation and uninstallation. For each platform, the required file format is as follows:

- **Android**: APK file
- **Windows**: MSI file
- **Linux**: DEB file
- **Mac**: PKG file

On Android, it is also possible to uninstall applications:

```kotlin
import io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools.appmanager.getAppInstaller

val appInstaller = getAppInstaller()

// Uninstall an app by package name
appInstaller.uninstallApp("com.example.app") { success, message ->
    if (success) {
        println("Uninstall started: $message")
    } else {
        println("Failed to uninstall: $message")
    }
}

// Uninstall the current app
appInstaller.uninstallApp { success, message ->
    if (success) {
        println("Uninstall started: $message")
    } else {
        println("Failed to uninstall: $message")
    }
}
```

On **Windows**, you can configure the installation of an app by setting `WindowsConfig.requireAdmin` to `true` or `false` depending on your needs. By default, this value is `true`. For example:

```kotlin
WindowsConfig.requireAdmin = false 
```

### ReleaseFetcher

The releasefetcher module simplifies release management with GitHub:

```kotlin
import io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools.releasefetcher.github.GitHubReleaseFetcher

val releaseFetcher = GitHubReleaseFetcher(owner = "owner", repo = "repo")

// Check for updates
releaseFetcher.checkForUpdate { latestVersion, changelog ->
    println("New version available: $latestVersion")
    println("Changelog: $changelog")
}

// Fetch download link for the current platform
val release = releaseFetcher.getLatestRelease()
val downloadLink = releaseFetcher.getDownloadLinkForPlatform(release!!)
println("Download link: $downloadLink")
```

#### How GitHub Release Fetcher Works

- **Latest Release Retrieval**: The `GitHubReleaseFetcher` fetches the latest release from the specified GitHub repository. It checks the tag name of the release to extract the version number.
- **Version Comparison**: The current application version is compared with the latest release version. If the latest version is greater, it signals that an update is available.
- **Platform-specific Asset Search**: Based on the platform (e.g., Android, Windows, Linux, Mac), it identifies assets in the release matching the appropriate file extension (e.g., `.apk` for Android, `.msi` for Windows) and retrieves the download link.

#### Downloader

The Downloader class provides functionality for downloading application files with progress tracking:

```kotlin
import io.github.kdroidfilter.platformtools.releasefetcher.Downloader

val downloader = Downloader()

suspend fun downloadAppFile(downloadUrl: String) {
    downloader.downloadApp(downloadUrl) { percentage, file ->
        if (percentage >= 0) {
            println("Download progress: $percentage%")
        } else {
            println("Download failed")
        }

        file?.let {
            println("Downloaded file: ${it.absolutePath}")
        }
    }
}
```

## üõå Additional Advice

For Compose Desktop configuration under Windows, you can structure your settings as follows to optimize installation and ensure smooth operation:

```kotlin
compose.desktop {
    application {
        mainClass = "com.kdroid.sample.MainKt"
        nativeDistributions {
            targetFormats(TargetFormat.Msi, TargetFormat.Deb, TargetFormat.Pkg)
            windows {
                perUserInstall = true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Setting `perUserInstall = true` avoids requiring admin rights during installation and enables background updates. **Note:** This feature is not feasible on Linux or Mac.
